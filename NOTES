Stuff I'd change in a facier implementation

- separate types for vec3, color, mat etc
- write to files other than ppm
- ppm writer as a separate class
- probably better to not cout the ppm write.. seems slow
- in ray class 'a' and 'b' are not very clear
- do a real spherical environment
- should delay normal calculation
- hitable_list should have a vector or something to allow adding/deleting, not just an array. also handle deletion correctly
- use <random> instead of drand48 ?
- figure out why float version has a lot of dark bands. oh its just epsilon problem
- interesting he uses hit epsilon of just 0.001
- gamma correction of 2 is a bit weird


i like passing t_min and t_max to the ray hit function.. can skip calculations
if its obvious object is outside of range
