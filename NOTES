Stuff I'd change in a facier implementation

- separate types for vec3, color, mat etc
- write to files other than ppm
- ppm writer as a separate class
- in ray class 'a' and 'b' are not very clear
- do a real spherical environment
- should delay normal calculation
- hitable_list should have a vector or something to allow adding/deleting, not just an array. also handle deletion correctly

i like passing t_min and t_max to the ray hit function.. can skip calculations
if its obvious object is outside of range
